%h1 How it Works:

%article
  %h2 1. Connect your Twitter Account
  %p
    Once you've connected your Twitter account by #{link_to "signing in", "/auth/twitter"}, the 
    %strong @bluepassers
    Twitter account will follow you. 
    %br
    %strong If your account protects tweets, be sure to approve this follow!

  %h2 2. Tweet your Flight Number on the day of your flight
  %p
    Simply include the flight number of your flight before you fly in a tweet (or a direct message to @bluepassers, if you prefer). We'll pick this up and add your flight to the website!
    %br
    There are a few different formats you can use - the choice is yours! Here are some examples (assuming you are on flight 411):

    #tweet-examples
      = image_tag "tweet_example.png", :alt => "BluePassers tweet example."
      %ul
        %li #411
        %li flight 411
        %li flt 411
        %li JetBlue 411
        %li #B6411
        %li #JBU411


%h1 Get notified of other bluepassers on your flight...

%article
  %p If it's enabled in your #{link_to "account settings", edit_account_path}, we can send a tweet to all BluePassers on the same flight so you can meet other pass holders.
